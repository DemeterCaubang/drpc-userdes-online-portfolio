<h1>Design Thinking Perception</h1>

<div class="text-part">
<p>Before we define what design thinking is, let us observe how design thinking is
observed.</p>

<p>A YouTube channel called NNGroup conducted a study on the perception of how UX
professionals view design thinking (Gibbons, 2019). From their findings, there is an observed
commonality in the participant’s responses. Characteristic-like traits are attributed to design
thinking. The researchers inferred that such an association is due to tangibility, consistency, and
popularity.

<p>Tangibility refers to how abstract concepts are actuated into the physical realm. Much
like Nodder’s definition of user design, wherein developers need to translate solutions to pain
points into a system the machine understands (Nodder, 2017).</p>

<p>Consistency is the relevance of the problem; if companies aim to tackle the same
hurdles in product development. The persistence of the problem prompts innovation, thus the
demand for design thinking</p>

<p>Popularity refers to the universal understanding of design features- like a floppy disk
logo can mean "save file" or how swiping up and down on a smartphone enables scrolling.
Common features are implemented because it is easily understandable, and majority of people
agreed that certain ways of navigation are the standard.</p>

<h1>Design Thinking Definition</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>Gibbons and NNGroup also asked participants to define design thinking (Gibbons, 2019).
According to their research, professionals' responses were in-line with three mental models:
design thinking as a strict process, design thinking as a mindset, and design thinking as a toolkit.</p>
<p>Design thinking as a strict process refers to how designers aim to meet a goal, which is
usually solving problems their clients have. Design thinking as a mindset is how we change our
own perception and logic; to think outside the box and innovate. Design thinking as a toolkit
refers to the ability to actuate solutions that people will use. It instills curiosity- taking apart a
problem to see the underlying traits hindering the designers and end users.</p>
<p>Courtney best summarized the definition of design thinking using the mental models:
"Design thinking is a philosophy and a set of tools to help you solve problems in a creative way"
(Courtney, 2020).</p>
<p>Interaction Design Foundation further solidifies their definitions, as they view design
thinking as "a non-linear, iterative process that teams use to understand users, challenge
assumptions, redefine problems and create innovative solutions to prototype and test.
Involving five phases—Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test—it is most useful to
tackle problems that are ill-defined or unknown" (Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.).

<p>Courtney, Gibbons, and Interaction Design Foundation did define design thinking as a
process, but it is very flexible. That is why the process is utilized by many fields, not just in user
design. The five phases of the design thinking process is only a map to guide the development
of solutions (Courtney, 2020). The steps are not concrete procedures and are freeform,
enabling creativity and instilling innovation.</p>

<h1>Creative Pointers for the Design Thinking Process
</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>The Design Thinking Process has been overstated in both our lesson and the sources.
We now have a better idea of what design thinking is, now let us enhance our problem solving
and creative skills. This section enlists unique creative pointers from a Pawel Zebrowski.</p>
<img src="images/guidequestions2/6.png">
<h3>image credit: YouTube[5]</h3>
<p>Zebrowski conducted a TedTalk last 2016 entitled "Design thinking – what, how, why,
when?" He shares valuable insight about the design process, plus tips on how to effectively
iterate the steps.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>In the ideation phase, he says a team does not only design a product, but also a user
experience. Products are constantly being updated to cope with the current situation- the
economical, demographical, social, ecological aspects of the consumer landscape. Zebrowski
enumerates two steps in the ideation phase that must done: visualize and move around.</p>
<p>Visualize the product through drawings and prototypes, not through descriptions or
conversation. While brainstorming, move around. "Do anything else- walk, crouch, jump,
stretch, but do not sit." Zebrowski states that moving around triggers more blood flow and
sends more energy to the brain. It encourages productivity and creativity.</p>
<p>In the prototyping phase, Zebrowski says "If the user does not understand it there is a
mistake." Quite justifiable, as the users are the ones who are going to use the product, not the
designers. Since the problem the designers aim to solve is not their own, there are factors that
can be overlooked.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>Overall, Zebrowski offers this piece of advice about what Design Thinking needs: "We
need to be more open. Talk to the people that are in the environment and share the
knowledge. We need to believe that a paper prototype can give us how our market looks like.
And we need to be more curious about the innovation in our market."</p>
