<p>Website elements are arranged ascertain way: the images, texts, and links. The
organization of these elements are required if the developer wants the proper message to be
sent.</p>

<p>One way to arrange text in a website is taking advantage of the different font elements,
mainly font style and font size, and font decoration.

<h1>Information Hierarchy</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>There are many different fonts, each with defining features. The distinguishment can be
categorized by font styles. Each style portrays a theme - like sans-serif being very plain and
technical, serif being semi-formal, and cursive script being elegant.
</p>
<p>Font size, when paired with font style, can portray emphasis. The bigger the size, the
more it draws the reader's eyes. It is also a technique used in newspaper layouts. The headline
is the biggest font, and usually contains the main idea of the article. It can be a standalone
portrayer of information yet entice viewers to read the rest of the article.</p>
<p>Font size can also portray emphasis, but what if you want to distinguish text that is
within the article? The header would naturally be bigger, and it would look weird if the inline
text is bigger than the rest of the text. That is why font decoration exists. You can underline,
bolden, italicize text to further emphasize main points.</p>

<div class ="section-area">
<h1>Whitespace</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>Whitespace is the unoccupied part of a page. It surprisingly draws the reader's attention
to the rest of the elements, plus grouping them. I appreciate whitespace more due to mobile
UI. They make use of whitespace to focus more on visuals and iconography.</p>

<h1>Color</h1>

<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>Color is abstract to me. It can portray emotion and direction through gradience. Even
when learning about color theory, I don't understand color's alluring properties. I just look at a
color and think it looks nice.
</p>

<p>When combining color to make a scheme, I find it funny when I adjust the original color
to the point that it doesn't look like it was ever edited.</p>

<h1>How I applied the concepts</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>I used different fonts for different sections of the article. I did not initially want to
include cursive because it is hard to read. When I needed a distinguished font, that was the only
time I considered using cursive.</p>

<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>I like the serif font a lot, but it does not look nice for heavy content. I've seen similar
font styles for typewriter print and case reports, so maybe it depends on the profession. I had
trouble filling up the whitespace and ended up using different containers as borders of borders
of text. Quite redundant, but it provides enough contrast between the content and the
background.</p>
<p>Color was the hardest element for me to use. No color pallets online had my complete
vision. I associated the sections with a strict certain color, so accents were limited to a shade or
hue. In the end I did make a mesmerizing website because the colors pop.</p>
