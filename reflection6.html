<p>Cooper black, oh my what an undying font! Its relevance persists until this day as it is
being used as decorative fonts all over the world. I have newfound appreciation for the font
and how it stands out from the other fonts.</p>
<p>Its slanted o, rounded serifs, and legibility even when the letters are compacted
considered the printing technology of the 1920s. I respect the design a lot now because of how
thoughtful it is, and how the video pointed out these nuances I enumerated about the font.</p>
<p>I found it cool that the Philippines was featured in one of the photos, using the font as a
lechon seller's signage. We help maintain the relevance of Cooper Black! I remember first
seeing the font as Total Girl’s logo. It is a magazine published by Summit Media targetting 10-
12-year-old girls, "tweens".

<h2>Perfect paragraph</h2>

<p>There is such a thing! There is a discovered ideal ratio for paragraph layout. Using an equilateral triangle, betterwebtype best explained it with an interactive game that font size, line height, and line width are proportional to one another. It is a very practical concept in my opinion. Admittedly I still played it by ear when applying the triangular theory. It was frustrating but entertaining to try the game.

<h2>Brands</h2>

<p>Brandseen tests if one knows the true hue of the popular brands. I see these logos often yes but based on the results I am not keen on their particular shade. I find it "huemorous" that my shade is way off from the original color. I think it has a lot to do with where I see the logos.
Most of the big brands I view on signage under sunlight, so the logos appear brighter than their
actual color. I appreciate colors more because of this game, and how specific shades are taken
into consideration when logos are enlarged.

<h2>Letter games</h2>

<p>KernType is a game that requires one to evenly space the letters of the font name. There were
no guidelines to space out the letters, only the fixed position of the first and last letter. I like
this precision challenge, and I started noticing font details I didn’t see before; like how there is equal spacing even between serifs. I also find it cool that after solving a round, the website
provides the history of the font.</p>
<p>The other letter related game is TypeWar. It is a score incrementing game wherein you must
guess the font of a single letter. I became hyper focused on the italication and serifs. There are
subtle differences between the print and serif fonts, like the roundness of the letters, the
thickness of their stroke, and the slant of their lines. I wanted to reach 100 points, but I am not
patient enough to make it reach that far.</p>

<p>Overall, I learned a lot from these simple games. They effectively teach what elements are taken into consideration when designing for different scales. I hope to design my font ubiquitous font or snazzy logo someday, and it’s gonna be great!</p>
