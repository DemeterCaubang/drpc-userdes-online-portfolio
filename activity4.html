<h2>How can we improve this?</h2>
<p>Font: make use of different text fonts and decorators to make invitees want to read the passage</p>
<p>Layout: have varying text sizes to emphasize importance of information, and have line spacing
to make the overall passage look neater and more organized</p>
<p>Visual: use images that can give a hint as to what is expected of the event, to entice invitees to
read the text</p>
<p>Contact Information: provide an actual number to add legitimacy and proper courtesy to the
invitation, not just the names of the hosts</p>

<h2>What would be the objective function?</h2>
<p>The passage aims to invite guests for Robert and Alexandra's after-dinner party event. It does so
in a formal yet festive tone. The invitation also encourages people who will be attending the
event to coordinate with the hosts by June 1.</p>
