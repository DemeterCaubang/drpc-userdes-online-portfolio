<p>Design is making something especially functional to fit a set of criteria.According to merriam-webster dictionary, design is to create, fashion, execute, or construct according to plan.It can also be customizing a process or material to suit specific needs. For example, the retail industry.</p>

<p>Designing clothes can be efficient and aesthetically pleasing yet practical. A fashionable item is desirable when it fits the wearer's body type, fashion preferences, and if the clothing is comfortable when worn for long periods of time. Reusability of the clothing may also be considered.</p>

<h3>image credit: Dabkowski, C.(2016) [7]</h3>
<p>Designing can be an artform. Many kinetic buildings and very well-planned software systems look very pleasing and are clear in their purpose. Designing of something of that scale is a mastery, an expertise. In the IT field, design is fundamental to providing an efficient workaround for technology-related problems (Nodder, 2017).</p>

<p>User design is the creation of a digital experience tailored to the user's wants and needs (Nodder, 2017). User-centered design is an iterative design process framework that incorporates validation from the user every step of the way. This closeness and frequent interaction helps you deeply understand your user, what they want and don't want from your design, and how they're ultimately going to interact with each part of your product (Tran, 2019).</p>

<h1>What is the difference between User Experience Design and User Interface Design? Why does it matter?</h1>

<h3>image credit: legaltranslations (2020) [9]</h3>
<p>User Experience Design focuses on how the user will use the app and be compelled to continue using it. This requires data of empathy-based concepts needing to be translated into a systematic product (Nodder,2017).</p>

<p>User Interface Design deals with how the app will look. They deal with the layout, typography, and iconography of the app. Make it look attractive and usable (DesignCourse, 2019).</p>

<p>Distinguishing the two concepts is significant to maintain organization and quick, cost-effective deployment of the app. Yes, the app may be functional for the developers but not easily understood by the actual users. The app may even just look good but not serve much purpose. User design requires both experience and interface to sync and collaborate (DesignCourse, 2019) to produce the most emotionally impact application (Nodder, 2017).</p>

<p>The users are the clients of the service, the reason user design will be conducted. Usersare sources of data with pain points (Nodder, 2017). Users are people who interact with technology that help overcome certain tasks.</p>

<p>For example, a business would need to have online presence to garner more widespread recognition. Their basic information would be required, such as what their company does, what they sell, and how customers can contact the business. An well-designed website will be of convenience to the users, which are the company owners, customers, and affiliated business.</p>

<p>Users want to just utilize technology to help them in their everyday life but they lack the expertise to do so. It is up to the UI/UX specialist to bridge digital solutions with users. Being able to translate user frustrations into a systematic and technological solution indeed requires specialized design services. Efficient utilization of technology empowers people to push boundaries in their respective fields (Nodder, 2017).</p>
