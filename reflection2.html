<p>When something catches my eye and I find a practical use for it in my everyday life, I think “Hey,
this is well-designed”. Most things I define as well-designed are material- furniture that fits the theme of
a room, clothes that accentuate the flattering parts of the body, sturdy and lightweight baggage, and
unconventional book covers.</p>

<p>As I learned throughout this course what design thinking is, I realized that the things I denoted
as “well-designed” were only characteristics of the objects on the outside. I did not consider the process
of how the objects came to be- how the furniture has to be ubiquitous to fit any theme; how the cloth’s
stitching is customized for certain body types; how baggage can withstand countless uses and still be
functionally fashionable; and how book covers attract the reader’s eye yet preserve the contents of the
book. I never really stopped to think about the technology behind the design.</p>

<p>I was always curious as to why I am drawn to certain aesthetics, but I became complacent to
enjoying the readily available products as they are. In class discussion, design is defined as not only a
product looking pretty, but the way the product aims to solve the problem has to be pretty too. This
idea by Buckminister Fuller stuck with me, as it expanded my mind and got me excited to delve deeper
into the design thinking process.

<h1>Learning the Simplified Design Thinking Process Cycle</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>The design thinking process has been simplified to three iterative steps: Assess, Design, and
Build. The process describes the user experience design cycle as well. First, we identify the problem
users have by assessing their pain points. Pain points drive ideation. Next, we create scenarios and
assess which ideas make sense or not, whether they solve the problem or not. Then we build prototypes
and have it tested by the target audience. Their feedback is taken into account, and the prototype is
reevaluated. Indeed, the design process is iterative and can get tedious, but following the sequence
yields the most effective end product.</p>

<h1>A Hindrance to my Design Thinking
</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>When I try to design something, I skip the assessment stage and jump straight to building the
product. I tend to overlook points wherein the design could be more reusable, and as a result the
product falls apart by the testing phase. I have not designed a digital system before, so my references
for the hindrance are my school art projects. I used to volunteer making props for group outputs. It is
fun coming up with quick and resource practical solutions. However, I focus on aesthetic and not
reusability. Most of the props become clutter when not used anyway, so scrapping them was for the
best.

<h1>Learning the Design Mindset</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>Now I get the opportunity to build a digital solution with a team. We have to go through the
processing sequence for optimal results.</p>
<p>Seven successful designers are pinned as role models by IDEO.org in what kind of mindset a
designer should take with solving problems. I was surprised that such distinct perspectives could talk
about the same topics. I could most relate to David Kelley’s Creative Confidence. Intentionally being
mischievous to make everyday more interesting sounds like a life goal. The partially nonsensical lifestyle
indeed enables more creativity. The most helpful mindset was about dealing with failure by Tim Brown.
He worded his mindset optimistically, taking failure as an opportunity to learn. Sounds a lot like a certain
someone I know. What ties all the videos together nicely is Emi Kolawole’s video about empathy.
Designers do what they do to solve the problems of users.
</p>
<p>Their mindsets are my inspiration to persevere in the face of uncertainty and hardship. I will not
be deterred so easily by setbacks in production or creativity blocks. When there is a will, there is way;
and there is always a way.</p>
