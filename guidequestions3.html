<p>Prototyping is a preliminary and sometimes physical simulation of a proposed digital
solution. It is an experimental process where teams aim to capture design concepts and test
them with users (Prototyping, n.d.). Prototypes give users the opportunity to interact with the
figurative digital solution; get a feel for the actual app. The material visualization gives a better
idea of how tentative features will work.

<h1>What is the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes?</h1>

<div class="text-part">
<p>Fidelity refers to the detail and functionality included in the prototype (Prototyping, n.d.).</p>

<p>Low-fidelity prototypes are very rough drafts of the app. It focuses on layout and showcasing
main features. This prototype utilizes minimal labelling, making use of simple shapes as placeholders.</p>
<p>This prototype is ideal for quick use and feedback. However, its portrayal of the actual features
may be too vague for the users to comprehend.</p>

<p>High-fidelity prototypes on the other hand, are highly detailed visualizations. The features are
well-defined, almost close to if the solution has been built. Users can clearly simulate interactions with
this prototype.</p>

<p>This prototype is ideal for accurate simulation and feedback. Drawbacks to this approach is that
it is time consuming to produce and the designer may be biased against changing the prototype.</p>

<p>The importance of prototyping lies in the finals stages of ux design. Before
implementing the actual digital solution, it is essential to test key features. The design team
aims to solve users' pain points and have to confirm if the features to be implemented will
serve their functions. Although prototyping is still partly iterative, it saves work on coding in the
long run. There would be less need to pull unnecessarily changes. Overall, prototyping is always
committed to users' needs in mind, particularly with an eye for user flow (Prototyping, n.d.).</p>
