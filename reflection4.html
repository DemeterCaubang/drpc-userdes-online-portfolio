<p>A highly structured topic is of great help for me to better understand something familiar
yet cannot be easily explained. Instinctively, how content is organized in a website is noticed
but is not always pointed out. For example, I can feel a website is convenient to navigate, but I
cannot state why it is so. It is nice that the concept is being discussed, as I think it will greatly
improve how we design our systems in the future.</p>

<p>I like the fact that information architecture takes into account the patterns of common
communication, data relationships and theoretical user flows. These concepts neatly tie in the
other subjects in the term, such as DATAMA and DESALGO. Data management for user queries,
and designing algorithms for link sorts.</p>

<p>There were many organization schemes touched in the discussion, and the ones that
stuck with me were content sorted by date and task. Our group can utilize this scheme for our
website. Most to-do lists and scheduling apps also use the date and task scheme, as mentioned
in the discussion. I was thinking also if sorting by category could provide a more dynamic task
view, but it would overcomplicate the query search.</p>

<p>Good navigation was also discussed. I didn’t think if someone were to share a link to a
page, it won’t always be the home page. Good navigation informs the user at what page they
currently are, and can point them into their desired destination. If I were the user on the
embedded page, I’d appreciate seeing the tree directory as part of the header in the article.
Then the navigation bar would provide links to the overarching topics that are not necessarily
related to the main content, such as About and Contact pages.</p>

<p>It would also be nice if that navigation bar allowed website search. Another factor to
consider is how the query result set will be displayed. I want to see the most relevant hits at the
top, like most web browsers. Search optimization can be achieved through social navigation, as
mentioned in the discussion. Whatever common searches other users have, those queries
become the most relevant. Collective query results can also provide see also navigation, for
closely related topics.

<p>The appropriate organization scheme, good navigation, and search optimization are
really part of the information architecture building process. The concepts are concrete
implementations for a digital platform, while the promise of user tenure is part of abstract
strategizing. In designing the user experience, it turns out that information architecture is
around the building phase, actuating features and anticipating user movement. The underlying
strategies and reasons for implementing said features are part of the ideation and scenario
phase; mostly theoretical. </p>

<p>I enjoy the serendipitous relationship of abstraction and implementation, especially
when the concepts are applied for building solutions. It is a challenge to efficiently apply all the
concepts of information architecture in designing user experience, but it will be worth it in the
long run. Less short-term problems, less tedious maintenance. Information architecture is
about “making the complex clear” to end users after all.</p>
