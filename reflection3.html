<p>Designing a website is an arduous task, especially when it is done by my lonesome.
Thankfully the final output will be accomplished by group. My mind was at ease knowing we are
a team aiming to produce something worthy of presenting.</p>

<h1>Design Problem Statement</h1>
</div>

<p>In our brainstorming phase, we followed instructions and focused on a problem we
wanted to solve; our pain points came afterwards. My groupmates suggested solving time
management for online classes and exercise. I combined the two ideas for the initial
presentation because both proved relevant during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We narrowed down the problem statement to time management for online classes
because it was more applicable and relatable. The problem also reached a wider scope, which
was in line with Miss’ recommendations.</p>

<h1>Personas</h1>

<p>Creating personas was the next task. We did not structurally formulate them. It was a dump of
ideas and mashing traits into three stereotypical characters. Due to time constraints and lack of
coordination, each of us submitted our interpretations of the established personas.</p>
<p>Each member had unique experience maps, which made for richer personas. We also had new
pain points that were not established as a group, which was a pleasant surprise. The aggregation of
thoughts expanded our scope even farther yet still remained in line with the problem statement.</p>

<h1>User Scenarios and Solution Features</h1>

<p>The next step was coming up with a solution through our website. We liked the idea of using the
Pomodoro time technique, and it propelled our storyboards. We wanted to amply showcase our
proposed features in the storyboards, which inadvertently produced a tentative low-fidelity prototype.</p>
<p>Our group had not discussed the actual website prototype before the second report, that is why
I was very impressed by how they could present well on the fly. Some features stated verbally in the
report were not featured in the storyboard or visualized in the prototype. We aim to remedy that for the
final presentation. I will do better to coordinate with my groupmates, as their ideas are the backbone of
our project.

<h1>Constructive Criticism</h1>
</div>
<div class ="text-area">
<div class="text-part">
<p>From the last three presentations, our group’s strong points were the personas and storyboards.
The simplification of our problem statement made it easier to refine our experience map, which was
also an applied recommendation by Miss.</p>
<p>Organization and creativity were our weak points. This is due to all our presentations (yes, every
single report) being crammed during discussion, and that we are not on the same page. I need to
communicate with my groupmates better to improve our organization. For creativity, I really
appreciated Miss’ recommendation of utilizing encouraging texts every time the alarm feature goes off.
It is a small detail that can is relatively easy to implement, plus it appeals to the users’ well-being. Maybe
also adding a feature that specializes tasks for online classes, as it is part of our problem statement.</p>
<p>As we are about to tackle our prototype, I worry about the delivery of our website, meaning if
we can really program the solution ourselves. I have yet to know the programming backgrounds of my
groupmates.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I am grateful for my inspired groupmates. They have really good ideas, and I am
happy to help them expound. We presented well on-the-fly despite lack of coordination, and I am
excited for our project to come into fruition.</p>
<p>In context of lessons, it was not that hard contextualizing pain points for our presentation
because of simplicity and relatability. We all have clear understanding of how managing time will benefit
us. I believe as a group, we are learning a lot about design, and we are amply able to translate our
proposed solutions into digital systems.</p>
