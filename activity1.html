<h1>Facebook</h1>

<h3>John3 [9]</h3>
<p>Facebook is a social media site that launched in 2004. It could be accessed online on desktop, then accessed on mobile in 2010. By 2012, they launched their mobile application on the mobile app center(Wikipedia, n.d [5]). That year is the same year I made a Facebook account and have been using the app ever since.</p>

<h1>The features I like about the app are</h1>

<h2>Colors and Controls</h2>

<h3>flaticon [6]</h3>
<p>The simplicity of the blue and white color scheme is easy on the eyes. Scrolling my feed is smooth. Prompts and button are easily understood. I find it relatively easy to navigate the app.</p>

<h2>Embedded Activities</h2>

<h3>Klammer [10]</h3>
<p>One can do a variety of online activities on the app: post, share, play games, and chat people mainly. The reaction and comment features are also very engaging. With many accounts signed up on the app, there is also a variety of content throughout user’s posts. The diversity of content is my go-to entertainment fix.</p>

<h2>Settings Abstraction</h2>

<h3>Cresnar [3]</h3>
<p>The privacy and terms are neatly hidden in the hamburger. Facebook understands the necessity and non-priority of this feature to users. Most of the settings are data privacy and phone related.

<h2>Learning Algorithm</h2>

<h3>Aybige [2]</h3>
<p>There are pages that other users share that I don’t want to see, and Facebook conveniently gives the option of hiding similar content in the ellipses at the top right portion of posts. True to its function, I do not see evident posts I am not fond of. The hide option even works for the users themselves, almost eliminating their activity from my scroll feed.</p>

<h2>Schoolwork</h2>
<img src="images/activity1/school.svg">
<h3>Flaticon [7]</h3>
<p>I registered for Facebook in Grade 7 because it was required by the teachers. Most recently, Facebook is integrated into the learning curriculum, utilizing the platform for making pages. These pages serve as grade deliverables.</p>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<img src="images/activity1/chat.png">
<h3>DMCA Report [4]</h3>
<p>This is in relation to schoolwork. Most update about school I get from Facebook. It is more convenient to do groupwork as well online when all members are active. I also chat relatives in the province through Facebook.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>

<h3>Anonymous [1]</h3>
<p>I enjoyed playing Tetris Battle excessively when it was still supported on Facebook. Now I mostly scroll Facebook for memes during my downtime. I also follow some pages about programming and user design.</p>

<h2>Pursuit of Interests</h2>
<img src="images/activity1/interest.png">
<h3>Freepik [8]</h3>
<p>Facebook was everyone’s creative outlet. I could see what others were interested in, then reflected if I like the same things too. Most times I keep the realizations to myself because I don’t know the people online well.</p>
